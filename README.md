# Sokoban Re Creation
This re-creation of the classic 1982 original japanese version of the sokoban game, attempts to create an accurate replica of the first few levels implemented using Unity engine, and to create an easy to use project files that allows easy creation and re-creation of levels.

The original puzzle game, the boxing legend, the really really simple, difficult, experience.

This is my attempt to re-create the original game's first few levels, in Unity.

One of my first few projects, re creating one of my all time favourite games.
